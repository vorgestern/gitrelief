**Gitreliefstarter** is work in progress. For using gitrelief it is optional.
It is intended for scenarios that involve several repositories, e.g. worktrees.
Saving the settings for each repository/worktree allows a robust workflow without
an open terminal for every one.

# Development status

Can only be built on Linux, since it needs gtk3.

Further development is pending better bindings to gtk3.

To build it, uncomment task 'starter' in config.nims and run

    nim starter
